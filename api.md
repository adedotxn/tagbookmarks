soo, the way the api works is this 

// On login, no user account is created or anything
// When they need to create tags, once they add a tag and click create, their twitter id is saved with their tags

// On the tag side
// It only works with tags created earlier and users select from that
// so,  on a tweet, when you "add tag", it saves with your twitter id, tweet id and tweet tags
// you can perform a read operation on tagged bookmarks page by checking the collection with user id and displaying tweets with saved user id
